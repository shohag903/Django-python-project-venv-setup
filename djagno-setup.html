Installing Django with pip in a Virtual Environment
1 . Update your local package index with apt

apt update
2 . Check which version of Python you have installed. The version currently shipped with Ubuntu 20.04 is Python 3.8.2:

root@Django:~# python3 -V
Python 3.8.2
3 . Install pip from the Ubuntu repositories

apt install python3-pip python3-django
4 . Install the venv package with pip

apt install python3-venv
5 . Once that is done, you can now start a new project in Django. Remember that whenever you start a new project, start by creating and moving into a new project directory.

mkdir ~/newhostA
cd ~/newhostA
6 . Create a virtual environment within the project directory using the python command that’s compatible with your version of Python. We will call our virtual environment my_env

python3.8 -m venv my_env
This will install standalone versions of Python and pip into an isolated directory structure within your project directory. A directory will be created with the name you select, which will hold the file hierarchy where your packages will be installed.

7 . To install packages into the isolated environment, you must activate it by typing:

source my_env/bin/activate
Your prompt should change to reflect that you are now in your virtual environment. It will look something like:

(my_env) root@Django:~/newhostA#
8 . In your environment, install Django with pip

pip install django
9 . Verify the version installed

django-admin --version
which returns

(my_env) root@Django:~/newhostA# django-admin --version
3.1
To leave your virtual environment, you need to issue the deactivate command from anywhere on the system:

deactivate
Your prompt should revert to the normal display.

Note: If you need to re-activate your virtual environment, moving back into your project directory and activating:

cd ~/newhostA
source my_env/bin/activate
Creating a Sample Project
With Django installed, we can now start to create our project and test it on your development server using a virtual environment.

1 . Create a directory for your project

mkdir ~/my-django
cd ~/my-django
2 . Create your virtual environment

python3.8 -m venv my_env
3 . Activate the environment

source my_env/bin/activate
4 . Install django in the environment:

pip install django
5 . To create your project, use django-admin <command> [options] which is Django’s command-line utility for administrative tasks. In each Django project, a manage.py is automatically created.

The startproject command enables to create a new project. The command creates a directory within your current working directory that includes:

manage.py which you can use to administer various Django-specific tasks.
a directory (with the same name as the project) that includes the actual project code.
6 . Create your project(myDjangoProject). Add a period at the end of the command to place the management script and inner directory in the current directory.

django-admin startproject myDjangoProject .
7 . Migrate the database (this example uses SQLite by default) using the migrate command with manage.py. Migrations apply any changes you’ve made to your Django models to your database schema.

python manage.py migrate
which returns

Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions

  Applying auth.0009_alter_user_last_name_max_length... OK
  Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
8 . Create an administrative user so that you can use the Djano admin interface using the createsuperuser command

python manage.py createsuperuser
9 . Answers the prompts which will ask for:

A username, an email address, and a password for your user.
An email
A password (containing at least 8 characters)
(my_env) root@Django:~/my-django# python manage.py createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'root'): scaleway
Email address: usertest@example.com
Password:
Password (again):
Superuser created successfully.
Modifying Django Settings
1 . Open the settings file

nano myDjangoProject/settings.py
To test your application, you will need to modify one of the directives in the Django settings. Locate the ALLOWED_HOSTS directive to define the addresses or domain names that may be used to connect to the Django instance.

2 . List the IP addresses or domain names that are associated with your Django server.

Note: Each item should be listed in quotations, with separate entries separated by a comma.

. . .
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your_server_ip_or_domain', 'your_second_ip_or_domain', . . .]
3 . Save the file and exit

Testing the Development Server
Important: Before you try the development server, make sure you open the appropriate port in your firewall. If you followed the initial server setup guide and are using UFW, you can open port 8000 by typing: ufw allow 8000

1 . Start the development server

python manage.py runserver your_server_ip:8000
